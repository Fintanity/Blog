# About Me

It is I. I am the one who is. The essence that is neither made of light, nor dark. A beauty that all eyes will and must behold; a treasure to those who need not look. Hear my words and drink from the cup of my unattainable, unmatched acumen. When you hear my name, the footsteps of my fleeing enemies will cry louder than their terror. Don't you understand? I AM HIM. The counterpart to her. The original. The source. The summit. Before you knew anything, you knew me. What's my name? Say it! Say it now!!! Raise your voice! Uplift me now and forever more. I AM ME!
